# Loops

Ok, this is a big one!

Loops offer us a quick and simple way to do something repeatedly.

Although there are a lot of different kinds of loops, they all basically do the same thing => they repeat an action some number of times.

> Note: That number could in fact be zero!

Different loop techniques offer different ways to determine the start/end points of the loop.

Statements for loops in JavaScript:

- `for` statement
- `do...while` statement
- `while` statement
- `labeled` statement
- `break` statement
- `continue` statement
- `for...in` statement
- `for...of` statement

## `for` statement

A `for` repeats until a condition is no longer truthy.
