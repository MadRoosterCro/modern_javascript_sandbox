## Numbers & Math object

`Math` is one of javascript's built-in objects that has some properties and methods for mathematical functions and constants.

It is not a function object and it works with the `Number` type.

### Explanation

All properties of the `Math` object are static. We can refer to the constant `Ï€(pi)` as `Math.PI` and we can call the sine function as `Math.sin(x)`, x being the argument in the given method.

> Important note: _Some `Math` functions have implementation-dependent precision. This means that the result may differ in different browsers and that the same JavaScript engine can yield different results on a different Operating System_

We can always check all the available methods and properties in a given object by entering dot(`.`) after calling the object.

### Math object properties:

| Property  | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `E`       | Returns Euler's number              |
| `LN2`     | Returns the natural logarithm of 2  |
| `LN10`    | Returns the natural logarithm of 10 |
| `LOG2E`   | Returns the base-2 logarithm of E   |
| `LOG10E`  | Returns the base-10 logarithm of E  |
| `PI`      | Returns PI                          |
| `SQRT1_2` | Returns the square root of 1/2      |
| `SQRT2`   | Returns the square root of 2        |
