## Numbers & Math object

`Math` is one of javascript's built-in objects that has some properties and methods for mathematical functions and constants.

It is not a function object and it works with the `Number` type.

### Explanation

All properties of the `Math` object are static. We can refer to the constant `Ï€(pi)` as `Math.PI` and we can call the sine function as `Math.sin(x)`, x being the argument in the given method.
