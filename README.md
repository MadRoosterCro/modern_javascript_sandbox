# Modern JavaScript excercises
## Vanilla only

HI there!

The plan is to create a base for people that want to start with javascript and to refresh my own skills.

For now I think I will create a new branch for each new "lesson" as I progress and then merge them into the default branch but keep them alive so that you can see the code-base.


Stay tuned!
