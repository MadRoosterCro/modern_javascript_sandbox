# Modern JavaScript excercises

HI there!

The plan is to create a base for people that want to start with javascript and to refresh my own skills.

## Vanilla only

The point of this is to use vanilla JavaScript and make it easier for beginners to understand how JavaScript works in its core.

#### The Plan

For now I think I will create a new branch for each new "lesson" as I progress.
You will find a different markdown on each branch explaining what its all about.

Also there are some basic files to get you started on each branch. For now there are only `index.html` ,`app.js` and the `README.md` files.

I would also recommend VS CODE as the IDE to get started as it is not complicated.

Some of the extensions I like are:

| Name              | What is it?                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Prettier          | Best code formatter out there.              |
| Bracket Corolizer | Make sense of your own code.                |
| Tabnine           | The best AI code completion tool.           |
| VsCode Icons      | Make that sidebar look nice.                |
| Live Server       | Local development server with live reload.  |
| ES6 code snippets | Code snippets for JavaScript in ES6 syntax. |

I highly recommend installing these, it will make your life much easier.

Anyways, to get started, select the 1st branch from the dropdown menu on the top-left!

Enjoy and stay tuned!

I started to add all the lessons to the main branch as that makes much more sense. Nevertheless, the individual branches will stay alive.

p.s. I recommend you to create your own git repository, that way you will also learn how to use versioning tools which is a must for development. :)

p.p.s. I will also show you how markdown works so your project/repo docummentation can look nicer. There is a lot of things you can do in markdown alone, here you can put links, thumbnails, tables, statistics, media etc.

> NOTE: If you start live-server, don't get confused by the different lesson directories, it will host all of the directories in the root, so just pick the lesson you are working on and keep on rockin!

p.p.p.s.
It is getting ridiculous with the peepees, I know, but if you have any questions feel free to contact me on the socials!
