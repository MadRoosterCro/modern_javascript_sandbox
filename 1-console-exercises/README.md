# Console

Ok, glad you are here, let's start easy!

Start VS Code and copy files from this branch in a new directory.
Now you should see 3 files in your IDE: `index.html`,`app.js` and `README.md`.

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser and then open developer tools to see the console.

> This is a good time to start your Live server if you installed the extension for it.

There are some examples already in the `app.js` file but feel free to play around and get a grip on how changing stuff in there affects the console in your browsers developer tools.
