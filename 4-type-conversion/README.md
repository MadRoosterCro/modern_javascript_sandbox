# Type conversion!

Variables in JavaScript can be converted to new variables and to another data type!
It can be done:

- by a JavaScript function like `String()`, `Number()`, etc.
- by JavaScript itself

The global method `Number()` can convert strings to numbers.

This means that strings containing numbers (like `'5.55'`) will convert to numbers (like `5.55`)

Empty strings will convert to 0.

Anything else will convert to `NaN` (Not A Number).

Please see `app.js` file for more explanations!
